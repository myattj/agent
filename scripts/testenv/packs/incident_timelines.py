"""Three full incident timelines.

Each incident is a single parent post in ``#incidents`` with 20–30
threaded replies showing the real flow: initial kickoff, triage
updates, fix attempts, resolution, postmortem handoff. These are the
longest, richest threads in the seed set — they're what the agent
uses when the user asks "catch me up on the X incident" via
``read_thread_context``.

The incidents intentionally reference the same services, runbooks,
and teammates mentioned in casual_chatter and qa_history so
cross-channel correlation (the "remember when Priya said Y last
week" pattern) actually works.

    Incident 1: Feb checkout-api 504 flood (resolved, postmortem done)
    Incident 2: Ingest pipeline Snowflake contention (ongoing, unresolved)
    Incident 3: Orders dbt data regression (recent, resolved same-day)
