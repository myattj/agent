"""Q&A history — the bulk of content `search_team_history` surfaces.

20 Q&A threads across #ask-data, #ask-platform, #ask-security,
#eng-general, and #oncall. Each thread is a parent question followed
by 1–3 threaded replies, mimicking the typical "teammate asks,
teammate answers, OP acks" flow.

When the user later asks the agent something like "what does the team
think about dbt vs Airflow?", the agent runs ``search_team_history``
and these threads show up. They cover:

  - Stack-specific how-tos (Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, EKS, Terraform)
  - Ownership questions (who owns service X)
  - Past decisions (why we migrated from X to Y)
  - Style/process questions (deploy windows, code review norms)
  - Debug recipes (how to investigate X error)
