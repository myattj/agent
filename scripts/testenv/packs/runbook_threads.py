"""Runbook-lookup threads.

Ten threads where someone asks about a specific runbook and a teammate
either links the runbook or summarizes the key steps. These are
designed to feed the ``/runbook`` skill — when the user invokes it
later, the agent's ``search_team_history`` will surface these threads
as recent mentions of the runbook, alongside the real file content
from ``acme-runbooks``.

Every thread namespaces the runbook filename (e.g.
``rds-password-rotation.md``) so the agent can link to it from both
history and ``code_search`` results.
