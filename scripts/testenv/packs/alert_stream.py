"""Alert stream — PagerDuty / Datadog / Sentry / Statuspage alerts.

~35 standalone alerts across ``#alerts-sre``, ``#alerts-data``, and
``#alerts-security``. About half have threaded human acks and
follow-ups (e.g. "looking"), mirroring what a real alert channel
looks like mid-week.

The alerts are seeded WITHOUT blocks for simplicity — plain text is
fine for the agent's ``search_team_history`` to index, and plain text
renders just as legibly in Slack as blocks do for short alerts.
Custom usernames from ``chat:write.customize`` make them visually
distinct from human messages in the channel sidebar.

Severity distribution: 60% SEV-3, 30% SEV-2, 10% SEV-1. Most alerts
self-resolve or are triaged and closed; a couple are unresolved, for
the user to drive triage against when testing.
