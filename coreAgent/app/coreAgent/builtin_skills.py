"""Built-in skills that ship with every tenant by default.

These are "reason to install" skills — they work out of the box with zero
config. Tenants don't opt in; they get these automatically. A tenant can
override any built-in by adding a skill with the same ``name`` to their
``skills[]`` config.

Design principles:
  - All regex triggers, no slash commands. The bot recognizes what's
    happening from natural conversation and acts — users don't need to
    learn any commands.
  - Prompts tell the bot to scale its response to the situation. A quick
    mention gets a quick answer; a full incident thread gets a full
    investigation.
  - No channel scoping. The triggers are tight enough to avoid false
    positives; let the bot reason about relevance.
  - In-process tools referenced in ``required_tools`` are merged into the
    effective catalog at match time, so skills work even if the tenant hasn't
    explicitly whitelisted those tools. Gateway/MCP tools must never be listed
    there: the connected server advertises them independently.
  - Graceful degradation: prompts only ask for external integration tools when
    those tools are present, and otherwise work from Slack and code context.
